# Images

The images are not committed to the repository because they are generated by a
[Python](https://www.python.org/) script.

In order to generate the images, you must have a Python 3.6 distribution
installed with the necessary packages. Every package this project depends on is
available in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed
through the [Python Package Manager](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/).

To do so, run the following commands in your command prompt or shell. First, you
must change directory to this project's root directory (that would probably be
the one called `bracis2018`.)

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The above will install every Python package needed. After that, you must run
the scripts which generate the images. Like so (again, you must be in this
project's root directory):

```sh
$ python scripts/convergence.py # generates the images related to convergence
$ python scripts/stat_tests.py # generates the images with the nemenyi tests
```
